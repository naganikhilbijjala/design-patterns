# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains sample implementations of various common design patterns used in software development.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories:

- **Creational**
- **Structural**
- **Behavioral**

Each category folder contains subfolders for individual design patterns. Every pattern includes an `index.ts` file with a sample implementation.

## How to Run the Code

1. Compile the TypeScript file:
   ```shell
   tsc index.ts
   ```
2. Run the generated JavaScript file:
   ```shell
   node index.js
   ```
